Software Engineering
---

The core Aquarium code was written and is maintained by Eric Klavins.
Benjamin Keller, Justin Vrana, Abraham Miller, and Garrett Newman contributed
new features, bug fixes, and documentation.
Eric Klavins, Justin Vrana, and Benjamin Keller developed and maintained the
Trident API.

Protocol Development
---

The UW BIOFAB protocols, only a fraction of which have yet been published,
represent the work of dozens of people. They started as hand written protocols,
and were translated into formal code. Most of the protocols have undergone
significant revision, especially as Aquarium's protocol language went from XML,
to Plankton, to Aquarium v1, to Aquarium v2. The main Aquarium software could
not have been developed as robustly if it were not for the efforts of protocol
authors, including:
Tileli Amimeur,
Nick Bolten,
Leandra Brettner,
Cameron Cordray,
Miles Gander,
Samer Halabiya,
Seunghee Jang,
Yokesh Jayakumar,
Jon Luntzel,
Abe Miller,
Garrett Newman,
Michelle Parks,
Sundipta Rao,
Ayesha Saleem,
Chris Takahashi,
Yaoyu Yang,
and
David Younger.

Laboratory Processes
---

Aquarium is used everyday in the UW BIOFAB, a cost center serving the University
of Washington synthetic biology community. The Aquarium software in some
essentially codifies the processes that the UW BIOFAB uses to manage its work.
The UW BIOFAB was started by Michelle Parks, who contributed to almost every
laboratory process, many of which were encoded into UW BIOFAB protocols.
Cameron Cordray and Samer Halabiya currently manage the UW BIOFAB, and contribute
know how and user feedback daily.
Tileli Amimeur,
Nick Bolten,
Leandra Brettner,
Alberto Carignano,
Orlando de Lange,
Miles Gander,
Kyle Havens,
Seunghee Jang,
Chris Takahashi,
Yaoyu Yang,
and
David Younger
all helped develop laboratory processes and protocols that eventually found their
way into UW BIOFAB protocols, lab management methods, or business logic
managed by Aquarium. In addition, most of the work the UW BIOFAB was done by the
following technicians through the Aquarium Technician Interface:
Lana Alabyeva,
Aza Allen,
Paige Almond,
Maggie Ankoudinova,
Noah Baker,
Halie Borror,
Aidan Cowles,
Sophia D'atri,
Asmaa El-Ghazali,
Gabriella Fier,
Muhammad Halimun,
Nathan Hwang,
Shamey Kassim,
James Leinas,
Lindsay Ng,
Andrew Olander,
Delaney Orcutt,
