# The Aquarium LIMS

This document describes how to use the Aquarium LIMS as a researcher. To learn how to set up the LIMS with your lab's sample and container types, see the
<a href="#" onclick="select('Lab Management','Inventory Definitions')">
Inventory Definitions</a>
page. The examples below use the Widget sample type definition, which is available in the test-workflow.aq within Test Workflow, found on the
<a href="#" onclick="select('Community','Workflows')">Inventory Definitions</a> page.

## Creating and Editing New Samples

To create a new sample, click **SAMPLES** in the Aquarium main menu, and then click **NEW** the the page specific tool bar. the NEW button will expand into a list of all Sample Types. Choose one, for example, Widget. Doing so will insert a new, empty, unsaved sample definition. You can add multiple new samples at time, by clicking **NEW** multiple times. If you click the X on the right, you can remove new, unsaved samples. For now, add two new, unsaved Widget types so that the screen looks like the following:

Next, fill in the forms to define your sample. To create a sub-sample for the second widget, click the arrows next to the word parent and click Widget. When you are done, your forms should look something like this:

Note that in the Parent field for the first sample, we have entered the name of an existing sample, "widget one". Here and elsewhere in Aquarium, if you type the first three letters (or more) of a sample name, the form will give you a list of list of matching sample names from which you may choose the one you want.

Once you are satisfied with your new sample definition, click **SAVE**.

Editing samples is similar. Find the sample you want to edit, click **Actions &gt; Edit** in the sample's heading, and edit the form.

## Searching for Samples

To search for samples, use the form on the left sidebar of the samples page. You can type in the name (or three characters from the name) into the "Sample Name or ID" field and click **SEARCH**. You can add a sample type name as well, to restrict the search, or find all samples of a given type by leaving the "Sample Name or ID" field black. You can also filter by project name or user name.

## Creating New Items

To create a new item associated with a given sample, find that sample and click **Actions &gt; New Item**, which will bring up a menu with all the containers associated with that sample type. Choose the container you want, and a new item will be made. The location of the item will either be automatically generated by a location wizard, or will be "Bench" if the container has no associated wizard.

### Searching for Items

To search for an item, enter the id of the item in the **FIND ITEM** form and click **FIND ITEM**. Doing so will bring up an item specific popup with information about the item, its location, and any associated data.

### Associating Data and File Uploads with Items

To associate data with an item, use the item popup and click **ADD DATA**. Fill in the key and value and click the arrow with a box around it to save, or the X to cancel. Similarly, to associate an uploaded file, click **UPLOAD** and choose a file. Fill in the key to use to for the upload and save as you would a data association. To view the file, you can click on the file name. Images will appear inline, and other file types will have download links.

### Changing Item Locations and Deleting Items

To move an item, enter a new location and save it. If the location is managed by a Wizard, it will check to make sure there isn't already an item in the new location. You can also delete an item, by clicking the trash can. This does not remove its information from the database and the item can be later restored if so desired.

## Managing Collections

To create a new collection, click the **NEW COLLECTION** button and choose the type of collection to make. Doing so will take you to the Collection editor page where you can add sample type information, associated data, and upload files using a spreadsheet like interface.
