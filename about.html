<p><b>Aquarium</b> allows a researcher to specify precisely how to perform an
experimental protocol so that lab personnel will run the protocol the same way,
every time.</p>

<p>Protocols encode how to manipulate <b>Aquarium</b>'s inventory system (LIMS),
compute formulae such as volumes, molarities, temperatures, and timing, as well
as present lab technicians with images and detailed instructions.</p>

<p>Protocols also define formal unit operations with typed inputs and outputs –
allowing the researcher to construct a complex workflow by linking an output
sample of one protocol to an input of another using the <b>Aquarium</b> graphical
workflow designer.</p>

<p>In the lab, protocols and processes are scheduled and presented to
technicians on touchscreen monitors placed throughout. Every step is logged: who
performed the step, which items were used, what data was gathered by which
instruments, and how long it took – data that can be used to debug and improve
the experiment. More importantly, Aquarium provides a complete, executable
description of the results obtained – one that could be used by another lab
running Aquarium to reproduce the result.</p>

<p>Aquarium was created in the
